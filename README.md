# Deep-Dive Python: Idiomatic Patterns, Tests, and Internals

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-Download-blue?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/janghelsaket758/deep-dive-python/releases)

A personal record of Python concepts I explore — from everyday features to advanced techniques. This repo packs examples, explanations, and deep dives into the language internals. It aims to help you read, write, and reason about Python code with more confidence.

Getting started
- Clone the repo:
  git clone https://github.com/janghelsaket758/deep-dive-python.git
- Move into the folder:
  cd deep-dive-python
- Inspect examples in the examples/ directory.
- Many examples use pytest. Run tests:
  pytest -q

Guided deep dives
- Bytecode and interpreter loop
  - Explore CPython bytecode and the eval loop.
  - Read examples that disassemble functions with dis and show opcode patterns.
  - See how compilers turn AST into bytecode.
- AST and metaprogramming
  - Walk AST nodes and perform safe transforms.
  - Build a small macro that rewrites simple list-comprehensions.
- Descriptors and attribute protocol
  - Implement data and non-data descriptors.
  - Compare property, descriptor, and __getattribute__ approaches.
- Coroutines and async internals
  - Inspect coroutine objects.
  - Show how event loops schedule tasks.
- Memory, references, and the garbage collector
  - Visualize reference cycles and gc behavior.
  - Use tracemalloc to profile memory hotspots.
- GIL, threads, and concurrency
  - Demonstrate true parallelism limits in CPython.
  - Show how multiprocessing and native extensions bypass the GIL.

Examples and recipes
- Idiomatic loops and comprehensions
  - Replace manual loops with comprehensions or generator forms.
- Context manager recipes
  - Implement contextlib.ContextDecorator and reusable context managers.
- Lazy evaluation patterns
  - Use generators and functools.lru_cache to delay work.
- Data modeling
  - Use dataclasses for value objects.
  - Compare namedtuple, dataclass, and simple classes.
- Type hints and mypy
  - Add type hints to examples and show typical mypy errors and fixes.

Sample code snippets
- Simple context manager:
  from contextlib import contextmanager

  @contextmanager
  def open_read(path):
      f = open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8')
      try:
          yield f
      finally:
          f.close()

- Minimal descriptor:
  class ReadOnly:
      def __init__(self, value):
          self._value = value
      def __get__(self, instance, owner):
          return self._value

Testing and CI
- Tests use pytest. The tests focus on:
  - Correctness of examples
  - Behavior under edge cases
  - Reproducible outputs for deep dives that log bytecode or AST
- Run all tests:
  pytest
- Use pytest-pythonpath in CI if you import from local packages.
- Example CI snippet:
  - Setup Python
  - Install deps from requirements.txt
  - Run pytest -q

Performance and internals
- Measure small functions with timeit and perf.
- Use dis to compare compiled bytecode for different implementations.
- Use cProfile for CPU hotspots.
- Use tracemalloc to find memory spikes.
- When experimenting, set up small benchmarks and run them multiple times.

Patterns and idioms
- Prefer explicit code over implicit behavior unless readability suffers.
- Favor generator pipelines for streaming data.
- Use composition over inheritance where behavior changes are local.
- Prefer small, testable functions with clear inputs and outputs.
- Apply functional tools (map/filter) when they make intent clearer.

Tools and workflow
- Use black for formatting and isort for imports.
- Use mypy for gradual type checks.
- Use tox to run tests on multiple Python versions.
- Use virtualenv or venv for isolated environments.
- Use pre-commit hooks to keep code consistent.

Assets and images
- Diagrams and visuals live in assets/ and docs/.
- You can preview images directly in GitHub or open them locally.
